# Ways to make this more complicated:
#   per-target rules, variables, and overrides.
#   implement BUILD/HOST/TARGET split.
#   optionally split SRCDIR and OBJDIR.

# XXX rename foo_cfiles to foo_sources, split into C and C++.
# XXX auto-distinguish C vs C++ link steps.
# XXX document include file locations. (./include)
# XXX automatically create Makefile in subdirectories.
# XXX could derive the location of mkrules from the path to toplevel...
# XXX install rules?
